# Embedded-Sentry-Project

- Programming language: C, IDE: Arduino
- Used a microcontroller (ATmega328p) and an accelerometer (MPU650) to record a hand movement sequence to
generally unlock a resource.
- The movement sequence is saved on the microcontroller and the device can only be unlocked when that
sequence occursï€
